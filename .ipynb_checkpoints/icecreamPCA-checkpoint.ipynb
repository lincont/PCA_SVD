    "PCA is a really useful tool for data analysis.  It can be used to lessen the storage/computation requirements for a dataset via dimensionality reduction.  This involves a coordinate transformation from the original feature space to a space defined by the principal components, which are linear recombinations of those features.  It can be quite powerful, reducing a data set from 1000s of features to a handful, which can reproduce ~99% of the variance in the sample.\n",
